# Complete Fix Guide - Real-Time CRUD Operations

## 🎯 Summary of Issues

**All 4 features are using MOCK DATA and not connected to databases!**

1. ❌ **Net Worth** - Partially fixed (add works, delete has issues)
2. ❌ **Debt Tracker** - Using mock useState data
3. ❌ **Savings Challenges** - Using mock useState data  
4. ❌ **Budget Templates** - No store exists at all

## 🔧 What I'm Fixing Now

I will completely rewrite all pages to:
- ✅ Use Zustand stores for state management
- ✅ Connect to API routes for database operations
- ✅ Add proper CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- ✅ Add edit dialogs with forms
- ✅ Add delete buttons with confirmations
- ✅ Show loading states
- ✅ Display success/error toasts
- ✅ Make data persist on refresh

This will take about 20-30 minutes to complete properly.
